I began developing this as a school project which I eventually presented in my final year. Even though the project is essentially complete, I still continue to work on it and add new features as I find it to be a great way to learn new things. The project includes a console application and desktop application with UDP multiplayer capabilities.",

The pieces are abstracted into their own classes with their own unique movement logic. The board is a 2d array of pieces and is responsible for validating moves, checking for checkmate, and other game-related logic.",
