Whenever a service is clicked, a modal will show up with scrollable images, each having a brief description. Also, there is a contact form that allows users to send messages to the company email address, which is handled by the EmailJS API. From there, the company can respond to the user's message to further speak about their business.",

It is very easy to use and helps speed up the time-consuming aspect of webpage styling. The site is also responsive and looks great on all devices. Because the site is hosted using AWS Amplify, it is very easy to update and maintain the site. All you essentially need to do is push to the main branch and Amplify will automatically build and deploy to the live site.",
